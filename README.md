HamiltonvilleArt Website

100% Vanilla JavaScript, CSS, HTML & JSON.

The JavaScript is primarily written in the style of ES5, in order to insure a reasonable level of older browser compatability, without having to bring in additional third-party tools.

The engine that drives the site's functionality is the *image-loader.json* file (data/image-loader.json). 

I've essentially built a poor-man's CMS. As new images and new directories of images are added, as long as they are properly referenced in the Image Loader JSON file, the site will automatically pick them up, without the need for code modifications.
